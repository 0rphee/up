## Socratic ignorance

__T24. Plato Apology 21a-e__

> Supposedly going to Delphi's oracle, he was said to be the wisest man alive. He could not beleive it, he considered himself not to know much. (He compares himself to a public man widely considered to be wise, but not really). Socrates knows he knows nothing, contrary to other people.

## The Quest for Definition

__T31. Aristotle Metaphysics XIII, 4, 1078b24-30__

> "became the first to raise the problem of universal definition(...)For two things may be fairly ascribed to Socrates: inductive rea-soning and universal definition, both of which are concerned with the starting point of science"

__T32. Plato Hippias mai. 286c-d__

> "'How, if you please, do you know, Socrates,' said he, [286d] 'what sort of things are beautiful and ugly? For, come now, could you tell me what the beautiful is?' And I, being of no account, was at a loss and could not answer him properly"

__T33. Plato Laches 189e-190c__

> "Then our first requisite is to know what virtue is? For surely, if we had no idea at all what virtue actually is, we could not possibly consult [190c] with anyone as to how he might best acquire it?"
